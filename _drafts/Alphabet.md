# The Rook Script Alphabet

37 is the minimum number of letters necessary to phonetically spell every word in my English, using one vowel per syllable. There are a couple of different ways of analyzing the sounds of English, but most people agree there are about 24 consonants and at least 13 vowels. 
<!--A minority of people don’t think “zh” or “ng” should be included; some people count the “ch” in Yiddish and Gaelic loanwords as an infrequent but thoroughly English sound. Most varieties of English have more than 13 vowels (Standard Southern British has 19), but I have a number of vowel mergers and can make do with 13.-->

This post will explore how consonants and vowels work in rook script and how they are organized. Hopefully it will be helpful in learning the forms of the letters and associating them with the sounds they represent. Other posts will focus on using them to spell words.

## Consonant Sounds in General American English

In English, consonants are determined by 3 features: place, manner, and voicing. Let’s explore what each of them mean for the sounds of English. 

When speaking, air is forced from the lungs out into the world. The space in between: the throat, the mouth, and the nasal cavity, are known as the *vocal tract*. At any point in the vocal tract the flow of air can be disturbed: it can be stopped, redirected, and forced through narrow openings of different shapes, making sounds heard as consonants. In English every consonant can be associated with a single place in the vocal tract. 

Say the words “peg” and “keg” out loud. The only difference between them is that “peg” begins with a /p/ sound and “keg” begins with a /k/ sound. Notice that when you make the /p/ sound you bring your lips together. We say the place of the /p/ sound is the lips, or that /p/ is *labial*. On the other hand, when you make the /k/ sound the back of your tongue lays into the roof of your mouth. We say the place of the sound /k/ is the velum or soft palate, or that /k/ is *velar*. In English all the places of consonants can be sorted from the front (the lips) to the back (the throat).

| place | adjective | consonants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lips | labial | /p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /w/ |
| teeth | interdental | /θ/ (th in think), /ð/ (th in those) |
| back of the gums | alveolar | /t/, /d/, /s/, /z/, /n/, /r/, /l/ |
| above the back of the gums | post-alveolar | /ʃ/ (sh), /ʒ/ (zh), /tʃ/ (ch in chair), /dʒ/ (j in job) |
| hard palate | palatal | /j/ (y in yuck) |
| soft palate | velar | /k/, /g/, /ŋ/ (ng) |
| vocal cords | glottal | /h/ |

Now say the words “dip”, “nip”, “zip”, and “lip”. From the table above, we see that the first sound in all four words is alveolar. What distinguishes them is the manner. When you say /d/, the air is completely blocked for a moment. We say the manner of /d/ is *oral stop* because it stops all the sound coming out of your mouth. When you say /n/, the air in your mouth stops completely and it is redirected into your nasal cavity. We say the manner of /n/ is *nasal stop*. When discussing English there is no confusion to simply call /d/ “a stop” and /n/ “a nasal“. And when you say /z/, the air is funneled turbulently through a small gap, producing a hissing sound. We say the manner of /z/ is *sibilant*, which is a type of *fricative*. English has a lot of fricatives (narrow gap and turbulent air) and only some of them are sibilant (producing a hissing sound), so we will usually refer to letters like /z/ as sibilants. And finally, when you say /l/, your tongue touches the alveolar ridge but the air is not stopped—instead it flows freely around the tongue in both directions. Being as specific as possible, we can say the manner of /l/ is *lateral*, meaning the air flows around the sides of the tongue. In English /l/ is the only lateral, but there are other consonants where the air is not meaningfully stopped but rather allowed to flow with relative freedom. These are the *liquids*, and they include a lateral, /l/, as well as an *approximant*, /r/, and two *glides*, /w/ and /j/. In English all of the manners can be sorted roughly from most obstruent (stops) to most sonorant (liquids).

| manner | consonants |
| --- | --- |
| oral stop | /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/ |
| affricate (stop releasing into fricative) | /tʃ/, /dʒ/ |
| fricative (non-sibilant) | /f/, /v/, /θ/, /ð/, /h/ |
| sibilant (fricative) | /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/ |
| nasal stop | /m/, /n/, /ŋ/ |
| liquid | /w/, /r/, /l/, /j/ |

Finally, say the words “teeth” and “teethe”; they differ by only the last sound. “Teeth” ends in /θ/, sometimes referred to as “soft th”, and “teethe” ends in /ð/, or “hard th”. The feature that distinguishes them is *voicing*, or vibration of the vocal cords: /θ/ is *unvoiced*, while /ð/ is *voiced*. Stops, affricates, fricatives, and sibilants in English usually come in voiced/unvoiced pairs. Nasals and liquids (and vowels) are all voiced in English, but they can also be seen as *neutral* since they don’t influence the voicing of surrounding sounds.

| voicing | consonants |
| --- | --- |
| unvoiced | /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /θ/, /h/, /s/, /ʃ/, /tʃ/ |
| voiced | /b/, /d/, /g/, /v/, /ð/, /z/, /ʒ/, /dʒ/ |
| neutral | /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /w/, /r/, /l/, /j/ |
