Rook script is an alternative writing system for English. There are 37 letters in the rook script alphabet: 24 consonants and 13 vowels, each representing a distinct sound.

In rook script, every word is broken up into syllables, and each syllable is piled into three layers. The middle layer is always a single vowel. Above the vowel is the onset layer, and below is the coda. There may be multiple consonants in the onset and in the coda, though not every syllable has an onset or a coda. If an onset or coda has more than one consonant, the consonants are read from left to right.

Every word in English has an official rook spelling, specifying both the sequence of letters and the boundary points between syllables. At this time the spellings are not stable as I frequently revisit decisions about which features of words to emphasize, and which words should be spelled similarly or distinctly. You can see the current spellings of about 1,500 words in the rook script [dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hr1Eyu2BLganoblsPMf3o-_bwgakcLiA/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112419566463325957235&rtpof=true&sd=true), and you can learn about the principles of rook script spelling in the pages of this blog. 

If you’re interested in writing in rook script, it is recommended to start with the alphabet. When you have the alphabet down, practice reading and spelling without worrying too much about the syllable boundaries. If you plan to use rook script in a professional capacity then you will want to make sure to spell correctly, including syllable boundaries.
