In rook script, every word is broken up into syllables, and each syllable has three layers. The middle layer is always a single vowel. Above the vowel is the onset layer, and below is the coda. There may be multiple consonants in the onset and in the coda, though not every syllable has an onset or a coda. If an onset or coda has more than one consonant, the consonants are read from left to right.
