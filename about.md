Rook script is a phonetic syllabic alphabet for General American English as spoken by me. It consists of 37 letters—24 consonants and 13 vowels—which stack into 3-story piles representing syllables. If you know the sounds the letters make, you can read rook script and write well enough to be understood. You can learn to properly spell about 1,500 words at the rook script [dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hr1Eyu2BLganoblsPMf3o-_bwgakcLiA/edit?gid=859358751#gid=859358751).
